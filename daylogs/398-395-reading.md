# 398-395 - Reading

After what felt like only a few hours, I looked up from my books to find that 3 days have passed. How time flies when surrounded by paintings, a cozy fire, and new decorations!

My new friend should be done enough with his web, so today I shall explore what lies further up.

This walk is a lot longer than I recall.

Spider has done it, I am now able to climb further north. Hopefully The King will not be too angry with my transgression...

Mushrooms! One of the only items I have been hoping to find. I initially stumbled across a variety that, when picked, glows. It did not taste too bad. I also found a green variety. This kind did not glow, and it made me feel... sick? Luckily I do not need food to survive.

It seems that once again I must return to my books as my exploration has only resulted in more disappointments and dead ends. I tried to bring a mushroom back home, but my friend's web most likely could not support the weight. 

I learned a new trick at least- it seems that, if I stand still long enough, I can close my eyes.
