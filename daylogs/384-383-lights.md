# 384-383 - Lights

I wandered the caverns a bit more to see if any other crystals were in need of rescuing- it turns out there were. Some interesting blue ones by my face friend, and a dark crystal from the south west caverns.

As it seems that there are no more crystals within reach, I searched for more coal brothers. The pinkish corridor seems to be constantly filled with coal, and I quickly amassed over 115 pieces at once!

I considered breaking the glass in the treasure corridor, but it seemed like too bad of an idea for now.

With nothing much left to do, I went to talk with my rock face friend again. For 100 of my coal, he gave me some knowledge- if I leave the caves, I cannot return.

What a terrifying thought- leaving this comfort for the unknown.

To assuage my mind, I've decided to wander in the Halls of Eternity.
