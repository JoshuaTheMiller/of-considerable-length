# 399-398 - Exploration

I decided to stand in front of the great mural I found yesterday. I finally deciphered it! It looks like there is a lot to explore, but I am not sure how everything connects quite yet. Upwards looks like quite a journey, but as stated yesterday, I am not to go up.

The cavern itself is fairly lonely... I've been exploring and picking up many pieces of coal. I had so much coal, that I drew some pictures of eyes.

After more reading, I could not take it anymore. The temptation from the day before was far too great, I went up. There wasn't much there, though I did make a spider friend! We tried talking, but I broke his web. Thankfully he seems to be a fairly optimistic fellow, and has already started making a new one! I wonder where it will take me \(as I've already been able to climb up other webs he has made\). So far, breaking the rule has not seemed too bad, we shall see. Time to head home for more reading.

Other accomplishments of today include:

* I finished my instrument and made music!
* Spent some immeasurable amount of time wandering in the Halls of Eternity... In doing so, I found a new face for my house, a rug, and many, many more books!
* I made a fire with some flint I found, it made time pass much more quickly!
* "Fully" explored the south western mines \(I even drew a map to help!\)
* Pushed a boulder, water runs somewhere now.
