# 001 - Temptations

The King told the Shade to never leave the caverns, and to wake him up after 400 days...

It appears that, not only is there a way to leave the caverns, but that I may be able to wake the King early. The consequences of either, of course, are completely unknown. For now I will play by the rules given, but the temptation is there.

Besides working past the various temptations, I spent a far amount of time exploring and getting lost in the caverns. I found many "fallen brothers," which appear to be pieces of coal. Am I coal? Time will tell.

Stumbling across the Halls of Eternity so soon was a treat. Stopping time and traveling in them for 20 minutes lead to some additional interesting finds. I wonder what else I would find if I continued for longer?

Accomplishments so far:

* Resisted the temptation to leave
* Explored the Halls of Eternity
* Drew two pictures of eyes

Are louse and lice the same?
