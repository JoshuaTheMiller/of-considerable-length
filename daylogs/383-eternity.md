# 383 - Eternity

Many pieces of paper later, and I have found a rug. These halls truly do seem endless.

## Player Thoughts

Between some of the thought bubbles the shade has, and the new information from the rock face, I am thinking that the shade is actually some sort of mind projection of The King. Perhaps, to "reset" himself, and to give himself a chance to learn from past mistakes, he sent out an infantile representation of himself to wander and to learn.

After recently finishing Steven Universe, I am wondering if this could also be a Pink/Rose/Steven kind of situation \(reforming into something new, having some memories, but really being entirely different\).
