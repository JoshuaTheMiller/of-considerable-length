# 395-391 - Wisdom

It seems that once again I have lost myself in my books. Ah well, no one is waiting on me yet. I should check on my stalactite though....

It seems that I should have continued reading, as the stalactite has not fallen. Time to read some more.

I feel... impatient? I must go check again. It should have fallen by now.

It fell! Now my budding curiosity can be partially satiated. What a strange feeling it is- curiosity.

What an amazing find, waiting has payed off- I have found a plank. I hope to make a bed soon.

It appears that there is a face in the wall... How odd. Wait, it talks! And, it offers wisdom... for a price.

I was able to trade for some of its wisdom, but it seems like I must collect more moss. I wonder, will I still have enough left for a bed after all of this? I do really want to sleep comfortably some day.

Once again, this feeling, this curiosity, got the better of me. I gave him all items he required, and now only have more questions. He says he will answer these as well, but he asks for items I have never seen.

I must explore more, and ponder these answers I was given.

For the King?
